# Teams Proactive Messaging Setup

How Dotbot installs itself for users and sends them question cards via Teams 1:1 chat — and everything that can go wrong.

## The Three IDs You Must Not Confuse

Proactive Teams delivery involves three distinct identifiers that look similar but serve completely different purposes:

| What | Where it lives | Example |
|------|---------------|---------|
| **Azure AD Client ID** | Entra ID app registration (`azuread-app.tf`) | A GUID like `97b86de5-…` |
| **Teams Catalog App ID** | Assigned by the Teams org-wide app catalog when you publish | A different GUID like `cfa7e7da-…` |
| **Manifest ID** | `teams-app/manifest.json` → `id` field | Must equal the Azure AD Client ID |

The **Azure AD Client ID** and the **Manifest ID** are always the same value. The **Teams Catalog App ID** is assigned by Teams when the app is published to the org catalog — it is _not_ the same as the client ID, even though both are GUIDs.

### Where each ID is used

- `TokenValidation:Audiences:0` → Azure AD Client ID (bot identity)
- `Teams:TeamsAppId` → Teams Catalog App ID (for Graph API `appCatalogs/teamsApps/{id}`)
- `manifest.json` → `id` and `botId` both use the Azure AD Client ID

If `Teams:TeamsAppId` is set to the Azure AD Client ID instead of the catalog ID, the proactive install will fail with:
```
NotFound: The definition for app '<client-id>' was not found in the org-wide catalog.
```

The catalog ID is set via the `teams_catalog_app_id` Terraform variable in `variables.tf`. To look up the catalog ID for an existing app:

```powershell
# Using an app token with AppCatalog.ReadWrite.All:
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/appCatalogs/teamsApps?$filter=externalId eq '<azure-ad-client-id>'
# Response → value[0].id is the catalog ID
```

## Graph API Permissions

Terraform (`azuread-app.tf`) manages all Graph permissions as application roles with admin consent. The GUIDs must exactly match the Microsoft Graph service principal's `appRoles` — there is no validation at plan time if you use the wrong GUID.

### Required permissions

| Permission | GUID | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| `User.Read.All` | `df021288-bdef-4463-88db-98f22de89214` | Resolve email → AAD Object ID |
| `Mail.Send` | `b633e1c5-b582-4048-a93e-9f11b44c7e96` | Email delivery channel |
| `TeamsAppInstallation.ReadWriteForUser.All` | `74ef0291-ca83-4d02-8c7e-d2391e6a444f` | Proactively install the Teams app for a user |
| `AppCatalog.ReadWrite.All` | `dc149144-f292-421e-b185-5953f2e98d7f` | Read/update the Teams app catalog entry |

### How to verify the right GUIDs

Permission GUIDs are tenant-specific to the Microsoft Graph service principal. To look up the correct GUID for a permission name:

```powershell
$token = az account get-access-token --resource https://graph.microsoft.com --query accessToken -o tsv
$headers = @{ Authorization = "Bearer $token" }
$sp = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/servicePrincipals?`$filter=appId eq '00000003-0000-0000-c000-000000000000'&`$select=appRoles" -Headers $headers
$sp.value[0].appRoles | Where-Object { $_.value -eq 'TeamsAppInstallation.ReadWriteForUser.All' } | Select-Object id, value
```

### How to verify what the app token actually contains

```powershell
# Get a fresh client credentials token, then decode the JWT:
$jwt = $tokenResp.access_token
$payload = $jwt.Split('.')[1]
# Pad and decode base64
$padded = $payload + ('=' * (4 - $payload.Length % 4))
$decoded = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString([Convert]::FromBase64String($padded))
$decoded | ConvertFrom-Json | Select-Object -ExpandProperty roles
```

If the roles don't include the permission you expect, the GUID in Terraform is wrong.

## Proactive Delivery Flow

`TeamsDeliveryProvider.DeliverAsync()` in `Services/Delivery/TeamsDeliveryProvider.cs`:

1. **Resolve user**: `UserResolverService` calls Graph `GET /users/{email}` → gets AAD Object ID
2. **Check conversation cache**: looks up `ConversationReferenceStore` for an existing 1:1 chat reference
3. **If no reference → proactive install** (`ProactiveInstallAndCreateConversationAsync`):
   - **Step 1**: Graph API `POST /users/{userId}/teamwork/installedApps` with `teamsApp@odata.bind` pointing to the **catalog app ID**
   - **Step 2**: Bot Framework `CreateConversationAsync` to open a 1:1 chat and store the conversation reference
4. **Send card**: `ContinueConversationAsync` sends the Adaptive Card into the 1:1 chat

### CreateConversationAsync parameters

```csharp
await channelAdapter.CreateConversationAsync(
    botAppId,                              // Bot's Azure AD Client ID
    "msteams",                             // Channel
    serviceUrl,                            // e.g. "https://smba.trafficmanager.net/emea/"
    "https://api.botframework.com",        // Audience — MUST be a valid URI
    parameters,                            // ConversationParameters with tenant, members
    callback,                              // Stores the conversation reference
    ct);
```

The `audience` parameter (4th arg) **must be a valid URI**. The M365 Agents SDK's MSAL module passes it to `new Uri(...)` internally. If you pass a bare GUID (like the bot app ID), it will throw:
```
System.UriFormatException: Invalid URI: The format of the URI could not be determined.
```

Use `"https://api.botframework.com"` for the audience.

## Teams App Catalog

The Teams app must be published to the tenant's org-wide catalog before proactive install can work. Terraform generates the manifest at `teams-app/manifest.json` but does **not** publish it to the catalog. The generated manifest is gitignored (it contains real Azure AD values); only the icon files (`color.png`, `outline.png`) are tracked in `teams-app/`. Run `terraform apply` to produce the manifest before packaging.

### First-time publish

Build the zip and upload via Teams Admin Center:

```powershell
$manifest = "teams-app/manifest.json"
$color    = "teams-app/color.png"
$outline  = "teams-app/outline.png"
$zip      = "teams-app/dotbot-teams-app.zip"
Compress-Archive -Path $manifest, $color, $outline -DestinationPath $zip -Force
```

Then upload at: https://admin.teams.microsoft.com → Manage apps → Upload new app

After publishing, query the catalog ID and update `teams_catalog_app_id` in `terraform/variables.tf`.

### Updating the catalog entry

If the manifest changes (new version, updated valid domains, etc.), the catalog entry needs updating. The app has `AppCatalog.ReadWrite.All`, so you can update it programmatically using the app's own client credentials token:

```
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/appCatalogs/teamsApps/{catalogId}/appDefinitions
Content-Type: application/zip
Body: <zip bytes>
```

## Configuration Reference

All config is set via App Service app settings, managed by Terraform in `main.tf`:

| Setting | Source | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| `Teams__TeamsAppId` | `var.teams_catalog_app_id` | Catalog-assigned ID, not the client ID |
| `Teams__ServiceUrl` | `var.teams_service_url` | Region-specific Bot Framework service URL |
| `TokenValidation__Audiences__0` | `local.bot_app_id` | Azure AD Client ID |
| `TokenValidation__TenantId` | `local.tenant_id` | From `azurerm_client_config` |
| `Connections__ServiceConnection__*` | Various | MSAL client credentials for Bot Framework auth |

## Troubleshooting

### Delivery shows `status: "failed"`

Check App Insights traces for the instance timeframe:

```kql
traces
| where timestamp > ago(10m)
| where message contains "<instanceId>" or message contains "fail" or message contains "error"
| project timestamp, message, severityLevel
| order by timestamp asc
```

Also check exceptions:

```kql
exceptions
| where timestamp > ago(10m)
| project timestamp, type, outerMessage, innermostMessage
| order by timestamp asc
```

### Common errors and fixes

**`Forbidden` on Teams app install**
→ The app token lacks `TeamsAppInstallation.ReadWriteForUser.All`. Check the permission GUID in `azuread-app.tf` matches the real GUID (see "How to verify the right GUIDs" above).

**`NotFound: The definition for app '...' was not found in the org-wide catalog`**
→ `Teams:TeamsAppId` is set to the Azure AD Client ID instead of the catalog-assigned ID. Or the app hasn't been published to the catalog yet.

**`UriFormatException: Invalid URI`**
→ The `audience` parameter in `CreateConversationAsync` is a bare GUID instead of `https://api.botframework.com`.

**`Request_ResourceNotFound` on user lookup**
→ The email address doesn't exist in the tenant. This is a caller-side data issue — verify the recipient email is correct.

## Deploying

```powershell
# App-only deploy (no infra changes):
.\scripts\Deploy.ps1 -AutoApprove

# Full deploy including Terraform:
.\scripts\Deploy.ps1 -WithTerraform -AutoApprove
```

After a `-WithTerraform` deploy, the app secret is rotated automatically (it uses `timestamp()` in `rotate_when_changed`). The new secret is applied to the App Service settings in the same Terraform apply.
